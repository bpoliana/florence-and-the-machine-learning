
i believe in you
and in our hearts we know the truth
and i believe in love
and the darker it gets, the more i do
try and fill us with your hate and we will shine a light
and the days will become endless
and never, and never turn to night
and never, and never turn to night


then it's just too much
i cannot get you close enough
a hundred arms, a hundred years
you can always find me here
and, lord, don't let me break this
let me hold it lightly
give me arms to pray with
instead of ones that hold too tightly


we have no need to fight
we raise our voices and let our hearts take flight
get higher than those planes can fly
where the stars do not take sides


then it's just too much
i cannot get you close enough
a hundred arms, a hundred years
you can always find me here
and, lord, don't let me break this
let me hold it lightly
give me arms to pray with
instead of ones that hold too tightly


and then it's just too much
the streets, they still run with blood
a hundred arms, a hundred years
you can always find me here
and, lord, don't let me break this
let me hold it lightly
give me arms to pray with
instead of ones that hold too tightly


i let him sleep and as he does
my held breath fills the room with love
hurts in ways i can't describe
my heart bends and breaks so many, many times
and is born again with each sunrise
and is born again with each sunrise


funerals were held all over the city
the youth bleed in the square
and women raged as old men fumbled and cried
"we're sorry, we thought you didn't care, oh"
and how does it feel now you've scratched that itch?
how does it feel?
and pulled out all your stitches
hubris is a bitch
a hundred arms, a hundred years
a hundred arms, a hundred years


and then it's just too much
the streets, they still run with blood
a hundred arms, a hundred years
you can always find me here
and, lord, don't let me break this
let me hold it lightly
give me arms to pray with
instead of ones that hold too tightly, yeah

your lights are on, but you're not home
your mind is not your own
your heart sweats, your body shakes
another kiss is what it takes

you can't sleep, you can't eat
there's no doubt, you're in deep
your throat is tight, you can't breathe
another kiss is all you need


whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah
it's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
you know you're going to have to face it, you're addicted to love


you see the signs, but you can't read
you're running at a different speed
your heart beats in double time
another kiss and you'll be mine

a one-track mind, you can't be saved
oblivion is all you crave
if there's some left for you
you don't mind if you do


whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah
it's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
you know you're going to have to face it, you're addicted to love


might as well face it, you're addicted to love
might as well face it, you're addicted to love
might as well face it, you're addicted to love
might as well face it, you're addicted to love
might as well face it, you're addicted to love
your lights are on, but you're not home
your will is not your own
your heart sweats your teeth grind
another kiss and you'll be mine


whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh yeah
it's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
you know you're going to have to face it, you're addicted to love


might as well face it, you're addicted to love
might as well face it, you're addicted to love
might as well face it, you're addicted to love
might as well face it, you're addicted to love
might as well face it, you're addicted to love
might as well face it, you're addicted to love
might as well face it, you're addicted to love
might as well face it, you're addicted to love

and the heart is hard to translate
it has a language of its own
it talks in tongues and quiet sighs
and prayers and proclamations
in the grand deeds of great men and the smallest of gestures
and short shallow gasps


but with all my education i can’t seem to command it
and the words are all escaping, and coming back all damaged
and i would put them back in poetry if i only knew how
i can’t seem to understand it


and i would give all this and heaven too
i would give it all if only for a moment
that i could just understand the meaning of the word you see
because i’ve been scrawling it forever but it never makes sense to me at all


and it talks to me in tiptoes
and it sings to me inside
it cries out in the darkest night and breaks in the morning light


but with all my education i can’t seem to command it
and the words are all escaping, and coming back all damaged
and i would put them back in poetry if i only knew how
i can’t seem to understand it


and i would give all this and heaven too
i would give it all if only for a moment
that i could just understand the meaning of the word you see
because i’ve been scrawling it forever but it never makes sense to me at all


and i would give all this and heaven too
i would give it all if only for a moment
that i could just understand the meaning of the word you see
because i’ve been scrawling it forever, but it never makes sense to me at all


no, words are a language
it doesn’t deserve such treatment
and all of my stumbling phrases never amounted to anything worth this feeling
all this heaven never could describe such a feeling as i'm hearing
words were never so useful
so i was screaming out a language that i never knew existed before

are you hurting the one you love?
you say you've found heaven, but you can't find god
are you hurting the one you love?
bite your tongue until it tastes like blood

are you hurting the one you love?
so many glasses on the tabletop
are you hurting the one you love?
you'd like to stay in heaven but the rules are too tough

tough
it's just too tough
tough
it's just too tough

are you hurting the one you love?
when they watched the walls, and the ticking clock
are you hurting the one you love?
and was it something you could not stop

could not stop
stop
could not stop
stop
could not stop
stop
could not stop
stop
could not stop

are you hurting the one you love?
when you leave them sleeping on the hollow ground
are you hurting the one you love?
and lost for themselves

are you hurting the one you love?
and if heaven knows, then who will stop
are you hurting the one you love?
you said you got to heaven, but it wasn't enough

in the celestial vaults
i drew bedraggled breaths
because i am unloved
i went as far as i could get
and the cedars like spires
wasting my goddamn time


past the museum of death
and the mad man yelling answers
i sail on new beginnings
and psychics taking chances
and the cedars like spires
wasting my goddamn time


as far as i could get
i went as far as i could get
and the cedars like spires
wasting my goddamn time


past the spires and the temple
looking like a disney castle
as far as i could get
past the girls late for rehearsal
oh, a pirate on the left
and jesus on the right
and the pacific sweeps through
like a bird in flight


as far as i could get
i went as far as i could get
and the cedars like spires
wasting my goddamn time


cause if i am unloved, i have unloved too
cause if i am unloved, i have unloved too


as far as i could get
i went as far as i could get
i went as far as i could get
i went as far as i could get


past the city and the sermons
the cemetery standing still
past the mountain and the monument
the houses and the hills
past the signs and the sirens
the sinners and the saints
i went as far as i could get
past the hallowed and the horror
the humbled and the greed
i went as far as i could get
cause if i am unloved, i have unloved too


as far as i could get
as far as i could get
as far as i could get
and i'm not far enough yet


i went as far as i could get
i went as far as i could get
i went as far as i could get
and i'm not far enough yet
i went as far as i could get
i went as far as i could get
i went as far as i could get
and i'm not far enough yet
i went as far as i could get
i went as far as i could get
i went as far as i could get
and i'm not far enough yet

this is as good a place to fall as any
will you build our altar here?
make me your maria
i'm already on my knees
you had jesus on your breath
and i caught him in mine
sweating out confessions
the undone and the divine, cause


this is his body
this is his love
such selfish prayers
and i can't get enough


whoa, whoa, yeah, ah, ah


spilt milk tears
i did this for you
spilling over the idol
the black and the blue
the sweetest submission
drinking it in
the wine, the women, the bedroom hymns


this is his body
this is his love
such selfish prayers
and i can't get enough


whoa, whoa, yeah, ah, ah


i'm not here looking for absolution
because i found myself an old solution
i'm not here looking for absolution
because i found myself an old solution


this is his body
this is his love
such selfish prayers
and i can't get enough
this is his body
this is his love
such selfish prayers
and i can't get enough


whoa, whoa, yeah, ah, ah
whoa, whoa, yeah, ah, ah
whoa, whoa, yeah, ah, ah

(oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
between two lungs it was released
the breath that carried me (oooh oooh)
the sigh that blew me forward (oooh oooh)


because it was trapped
trapped between two lungs
it was trapped between two lungs
it was trapped between two lungs


and my running feet could fly
each breath screaming, "we are all too young to die"


between two lungs it was released (it was released)
the breath that passed from you to me (passed from you to me)
it flew between us as we slept (as we slept)
that slipped from your mouth into mine (mouth into mine)
it crept between two lungs (two lungs)
it was released (released)
the breath that passed from you to me (you to me)
it flew between us as we slept (as we slept)
that slipped from your mouth into mine (into mine)
it crept
(oooh oooh oooh oooh ooh oooh aah ah ah ah ah aha ah)


because it was trapped
trapped between two lungs
it was trapped between two lungs
it was trapped between two lungs


gone are the days of begging
the days of theft
no more gasping for a breath
the air has filled me head to toe (head to toe)
and i can see the ground far below
i have this breath and i hold it tight
and i keep it in my chest with all my might
i pray to god this breath will last


as it pushes past my lips
as i
gasp, gasp
(ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

you need a big god
big enough to hold your love
you need a big god
big enough to fill you up


you keep me up at night
to my messages, you do not reply
you know i still like you the most
the best of the best and the worst of the worst
well, you can never know
the places that i go
i still like you the most
you'll always be my favourite ghost


you need a big god
big enough to hold your love
you need a big god
big enough to fill you up


sometimes i think it's getting better
and then it gets much worse
is it just part of the process?
jesus christ, it hurts
though i know i should know better
well, i can make this work
is it just part of the process?
jesus christ, jesus christ, it hurts
(jesus christ, jesus christ, it hurts)


you need a big god
big enough to hold your love
you need a big god
big enough to fill you up




shower your affection, let it rain on me
pull down the mountain, drag your cities to the sea
shower your affection, let it rain on me
don't leave me on this white cliff
let it slide down to the, slide down to the sea
slide down to the, slide down to the sea

well, i didn't tell anyone, but a bird flew by
saw what i'd done, he set up a nest outside
and he sang about what i'd become
he sang so loud, sang so clear
i was afraid all the neighbours would hear
so i invited him in, just to reason with him
i promised i wouldn't do it again
but he sang louder and louder inside the house
and no i couldn't get him out
so i trapped him under a cardboard box
stood on it to make him stop
i picked up the bird and above the din i said
"that's the last song you'll ever sing"
held him down, broke his neck
taught him a lesson he wouldn't forget
but in my dreams began to creep
that old familiar tweet, tweet, tweet


i opened my mouth to scream and shout
i waved my arms and flapped about
but i couldn't scream and i couldn't shout
couldn't scream and i couldn't shout


i opened my mouth to scream and shout
i waved my arms and flapped about
but i couldn't scream and i couldn't shout
the song was coming from my mouth


from my mouth
from my mouth
from my mouth
from my mouth
from my mouth
from my mouth
from my mouth
from my mouth
from my mouth
from my mouth
from my mouth
from my mouth
from my mouth
from my mouth
from my mouth

seems that i have been held, in some dreaming state
a tourist in the waking world, never quite awake
no kiss, no gentle word could wake me from this slumber
until i realize that it was you who held me under


felt it in my fist, in my feet, in the hollows of my eyelids
shaking through my skull, through my spine and down through my ribs


no more dreaming of the dead as if death itself was undone
no more calling like a crow for a boy, for a body in the garden
no more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
no more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
no more dreaming like a girl so in love with the wrong world


and i could hear the thunder and see the lightning crack
all around the world was waking, i never could go back
because all the walls of dreaming, they were torn wide open
and finally it seemed that the spell was broken


and all my bones began to shake, my eyes flew open
and all my bones began to shake, my eyes flew open


no more dreaming of the dead as if death itself was undone
no more calling like a crow for a boy, for a body in the garden
no more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
no more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
no more dreaming like a girl so in love with the wrong world


snow white is stitching up your circuit-boards
synapse slipping through the hidden doors
snow white is stitching up your circuit-board


no more dreaming of the dead as if death itself was undone
no more calling like a crow for a boy, for a body in the garden
no more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
no more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
no more dreaming like a girl so in love with the wrong world


snow white's stitching up your circuit-boards
synapse slipping through the hidden door
snow white's stitching up your circuit-board
synapse slipping through the hidden door

all alone
it was always there you see
and even on my own
it was always standing next to me


and i can see it coming from the edge of the room
creeping in the streetlight
holding my hand in the pale gloom
can you see it coming now?


oh, i think i'm breaking down again
oh, i think i'm breaking down


all alone
even when i was a child
i've always known
there was something to be frightened of


you know that i can see you coming from the edge of the room
creeping in the streetlight
holding my hand in the pale gloom
can you see it coming now?


oh, i think i'm breaking down again
oh, i think i'm breaking down


all alone
on the edge of sleep
my old familiar friend
comes and lies down next to me


and i can see it coming from the edge of the room
smiling in the streetlight
even with my eyes shut tight
i still see him coming now


oh, i think i'm breaking down again
oh, i think i'm breaking down again
oh, i think i'm breaking down again
oh, i think i'm breaking down

oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


i was looking for a breath of a life
for a little touch of heavenly light
but all the choirs in my head sang, no, oh oh oh

to get a dream of life again
a little vision of the start and the end
but all the choirs in my head sang, no, oh oh oh


but i needed one more touch
another taste of heavenly rush
and i believe, i believe it's so, oh oh oh

and i needed one more touch
another taste of divine rush
and i believe, i believe it's so, oh oh oh

whose side am i on? whose side am i?
whose side am i on? whose side am i?

and the fever began to spread
from my heart down to my legs
but the room is so quiet, oh oh oh oh

and although i wasn't losing my mind
it was a chorus so sublime
but the room is so quiet, oh oh oh


i was looking for a breath of a life
for a little touch of heavenly light
but all the choirs in my head sang, no, oh oh oh

to get a dream of life again
a little vision of the start and the end
but all the choirs in my head sang, no, oh oh oh


it's a harder way and it's come to claim her
and i always say, we should be together
and i can't sleep alone, because there's something in here
and if you are gone, i will not belong here (belong, belong, belong)


and i started to hear it again
but this time it wasn't the end
and the room is so quiet, oh oh oh oh

and my heart is a hollow plain
for the devil to dance again
and the room is too quiet, oh oh oh oh


i was looking for a breath of a life
for a little touch of heavenly light
but all the choirs in my head sang, no, oh oh oh

it's the hardest thing i've ever had to do
to try and keep from calling you
well, can my dreams keep coming true?
how can they?
'cause when i sleep, i never dream of you


as if the dream of you, it sleeps too
but it never slips away
it just gains its strength and digs its hooks
to drag me through the day


and i'm caught
i forget all that i've been taught
i can't keep calm, i can't keep still
pulled apart against my will


it's the hardest thing i've ever had to prove
you turned to salt as i turned around to look at you
old friends have said, the books i've read
say it's the thing to do
but it's hard to see it when you're in it
'cause i went blind for you


then you leave my head, crawl out the bed
you subconscious solipsist
and for those hours deep in the dark
perhaps you don't exist


but i'm caught
i forget all that i've been taught
i can't keep calm, i can't keep still
pulled apart against my will


and i'm thrashing on the line
somewhere between
desperate and divine
i can't keep calm, i can't keep still
persephone will have her fill


and i'm caught
i forget all that i've been taught
i can't keep calm, i can't keep still
pulled apart against my will

and i'm caught
i forget all that i've been taught
i can't keep calm, i can't keep still
pulled apart against my will

i tried to control my shaking
with just one sound
i tried to warm the ocean
by writing it down
i tried to tame my nightmare
line by line
if i write a song about you
does that make you mine?


the conductor caught in slow motion
the orchestra plays on
over and over; the same motion
this work is never done


the only thing that's certain
is your indecision
i guess it must be working
cause you hit me with such precision
now the strings are breaking
their fingers run with blood
but they keep on playing
the cycle never stops


who's in control?
who's playing who?


she wants to be amongst them
conducting them too
she knows the song won't save her
but what else can she do?
she weeps just like a willow
she's playing for you
she's fragile and she's ferocious
as the current flows through


she's a conductor caught in slow motion
the orchestra plays on
over and over; the same motion
this work is never done


now here comes the crescendo
the music starts to swell
and now it's so ecstatic
i know this part so well
and then it goes staccato
the notes were flying up
higher and higher
but they never reach the top


who's in control?
who's playing who?
who's in control?
who's playing who?


i am the orchestra
the conductor too
my heart is a concert hall
and i filled it with you

never was a cornflake girl
thought that was a good solution
hanging with the raisin girls
she's gone to the other side
givin' us the old heave ho
things are getting kind of gross
and i go it's sleepy time


this is not really, this, a-this
this is not really happening


you bet your life it is
you bet your life it is
oh, you bet your life
it's a peel out the watchword
just peel out the watchword


she knows what's going on
seems we got a cheaper feel now
all the sweeteaze are gone
gone to the other side
with my encyclopedia
they musta paid her a nice price
she's putting on her string bean love


this is not really, this, this
this is not really happening


you bet your life it is
you bet your life it is
oh, you bet your life
it's a peel out the watchword
just peel out the watchword


never was a cornflake girl
thought that was a good solution


rabbit, where'd you put the keys, girl?
rabbit, where'd you put the keys, girl?
rabbit, where'd you put the keys?
rabbit, where'd you put the keys?
where'd you put the keys, girl?


and the man with the golden gun
thinks he knows so much
thinks he knows so much, yeah
and the man with the golden gun
thinks he knows so much
thinks he knows so much, yeah
and the man with the golden gun
thinks he knows so much
thinks he knows so much, yeah
and the man with the golden gun
thinks he knows so much
thinks he knows so much, yeah


rabbit, where'd you put the keys, girl?
oh, rabbit, where'd you put the keys, girl?
rabbit, where'd you put the keys? oh yeah
rabbit, where'd you put the keys?
where'd you put the keys, girl?

a falling star fell from your heart and landed in my eyes
i screamed aloud, as it tore through them
and now it's left me blind


the stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
you left me in the dark
no dawn, no day, i'm always in this twilight
in the shadow of your heart


and in the dark, i can hear your heartbeat
i tried to find the sound
but then it stopped, till i was in the darkness
so darkness i became


the stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
you left me in the dark
no dawn, no day, i'm always in this twilight
in the shadow of your heart


i took the stars from our eyes, and then i made a map
and knew that somehow i could find my way back
then i heard your heart beating, you were in the darkness too
so i stayed in the darkness with you


the stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
you left me in the dark
no dawn, no day, i'm always in this twilight
in the shadow of your heart

the stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
you left me in the dark
no dawn, no day, i'm always in this twilight
in the shadow of your heart

drifting through the halls with the sunrise
(holding on for your call)
climbing up the walls for that flashing light
(i can never let go)
'cause i'm gonna be free and i'm gonna be fine
(holding on for your call)
'cause i'm gonna be free and i'm gonna be fine
(maybe not tonight)

now the sun is up and i'm going blind
(holding on for your call)
another drink just to pass the time
(i can never say no)
'cause i'm gonna be free and i'm gonna be fine
(holding on for your call)
'cause i'm gonna be free and i'm gonna be fine
(maybe not tonight)


it's a different kind of danger
and the bells are ringing out
and i'm calling for my mother
as i pull the pillars down
it's a different kind of danger
and my feet are spinning round
never knew i was a dancer
'til delilah showed me how


too fast for freedom
sometimes it all falls down
these chains never leave me
i keep dragging them around


now i'm dancing with delilah and her vision is mine
(holding on for your call)
a different kind of danger in the daylight
(i can never let go)
took anything to cut you, i can find
(holding on for your call)
a different kind of a danger in the daylight
(can't you let me know?)

now it's one more boy and it's one more line
(holding on for your call)
taking the pills just to pass the time
(i can never say no)
'cause i'm gonna be free and i'm gonna be fine

happiness hit her, like a train on a track
coming towards her, stuck still no turning back
she hid around corners and she hid under beds
she killed it with kisses and from it she fled
with every bubble she sank with a drink
and washed it away down the kitchen sink


the dog days are over
the dog days are done
the horses are coming
so you better run
run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
leave all your love and your longing behind
you can't carry it with you if you want to survive
the dog days are over
the dog days are done
can you hear the horses?
'cause here they come


and i never wanted anything from you
except everything you had
and what was left after that too, oh


happiness hit her like a bullet in the back, back, back...
struck from a great height
by someone who should know better than that


the dog days are over
the dog days are done
can you hear the horses?
'cause here they come
run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
leave all your love and your longing behind
you can't carry it with you if you want to survive
the dog days are over
the dog days are done
can you hear the horses?
'cause here they come


the dog days are over
the dog days are gone
can you hear the horses?
'cause here they come
the dog days are over
the dog days are gone
can you hear the horses?
'cause here they come

happiness hit her

leave all your love and your longing behind

she killed it with kisses and from it she fled

run fast

leave all your love and your longing behind
with a donkey on my shoulder
and a jackal on my back
i'll carry these, my children
keep them safe from attack

the donkey makes it hard to dance, the jackal sings too loud
the donkey cries when it's alone, and the jackal is too proud


little donkey is getting restless
getting heavier as it grows
and the jackal, spoiled and spiteful
keeps biting at my nose

i would have a lover
a husband, and a child
but the donkey is too jealous
and the jackal is too wild

you ask me why i keep them
why i love them so
why they get away with murder
as they grow and grow and grow, oh

i keep them cause i made them
they come from in my heart
with each mistake i make
created, and torn apart

and when it's time to feed them
before they go to bed
i give them my confessions
baked within their bread

x2
little donkey is getting restless
getting heavier as it grows
and the jackal, spoiled and spiteful
keeps biting at my nose

i'm not calling you a liar
just don't lie to me
i'm not calling you a thief
just don't steal from me
i'm not calling you a ghost
just stop haunting me
i love you so much
that i'm going to let you kill me


don't tell me what you've done
don't tell me what you've done
don't tell me what you've done
don't tell me what you've done
don't tell me what you've done
don't tell me what you've done


i'm too tired to fight
i'm just going to lay right here
but i'm too angry to sleep
without you near
i'm not at home with myself
but i'm not at home with you either
i'm too scared to leave
but i never seem safe here


there's a ghost in my lungs
and it sighs in my sleep
wraps itself around my chest
as it softly speaks
then it walks with my legs, with my legs
to fall at your feet

there's a ghost in my lungs
and it talks in my sleep
wraps itself around my chest
as it softly speaks
then it walks with my legs, with my legs

don't tell me what you've done
don't tell me what you've done
don't tell me what you've done

just don't lie to me
and i love you so much
that i'm going to let you kill me

there's a drumming noise inside my head
that starts when you're around
i swear that you could hear it
it makes such an almighty sound
there's a drumming noise inside my head
that throws me to the ground
i swear that you should hear it
it makes such an almighty sound


louder than sirens, louder than bells
sweeter than heaven and hotter than hell


i ran to the tower where the church bells chime
i hoped that they would clear my mind
they left a ringing in my ear
but that drum's still beating loud and clear


louder than sirens, louder than bells
sweeter than heaven and hotter than hell
louder than sirens, louder than bells
sweeter than heaven and hotter than hell
louder than sirens, louder than bells
sweeter than heaven and hotter than hell


as i move my feet towards your body
i can hear this beat, it fills my head up
and gets louder and louder
it fills my head up and gets louder and louder


i run to the river and dive straight in
i pray that the water will drown out the din
but as the water fills my mouth
it couldn't wash the echoes out
but as the water fills my mouth
it couldn't wash the echoes out
i swallow the sound and it swallows me whole
until there's nothing left inside my soul
as empty as that beating drum
but the song has just begun


as i move my feet towards your body
i can hear this beat, it fills my head up
and gets louder and louder
it fills my head up and gets louder and louder


there's a drumming noise inside my head
that starts when you're around
i swear that you could hear it
it makes such an almighty sound
there's a drumming noise inside my head
that starts when you're around
i swear that you could hear it
it makes such an almighty sound


louder than sirens, louder than bells
sweeter than heaven and hotter than hell
louder than sirens, louder than bells
sweeter than heaven and hotter than hell


as i move my feet towards your body
i can hear this beat, it fills my head up
and gets louder and louder
it fills my head up and gets louder and louder

i've fallen out of favor
and i've fallen from grace
fallen out of trees
and i've fallen on my face
fallen out of taxis
out of windows too
fell in your opinion
when i fell in love with you


oh-ooh, oh-oooooooh
oh-ooh, oh-oooooooh


sometimes i wish for falling
wish for the release
wish for falling through the air
to give me some relief
because falling is not the problem
when i'm falling i'm in peace
it's only when i hit the ground
it causes all the grief


oh-ooh, oh-oooooooh
oh-ooh, oh-oooooooh


this is a song for a scribbled out name
and my love keeps writing again and again
this is a song for a scribbled out name
and my love keeps writing again and again
and again
and again
and again
and again
and again
and again
and again
and again
and again
and again
and again
and again
and again
and again
and again
and again


i'll dance myself up
drunk myself down
found people to love
left people to drown
i'm not scared to jump
i'm not scared to fall
if there was nowhere to land
i wouldn't be scared
at all
at all
at all
at all
fall
fall


sometimes i wish for falling
wish for the release
wish for falling through the air
to give me some relief
because falling is not the problem
when i'm falling i'm in peace
it's only when i hit the ground
it causes all the grief
this song
is one i never thought that i'd play
but if you want me gone
there are kinder ways to say
so long than spitting in my face

they don't teach these things at school
they just lay down the rules which are there for you to break
which are there for you to break

if i'm wrong
then dust me off and put me in my place
drop a bomb
shall you blow me away without even a trace?
i'll be gone and i won't give chase

'cause when you're in pieces
you pick up the bits, and nothing fits
and the wind blows you away
and the wind blows you away
and the wind blows you away
and the wind blows you away

i pray
there will come a day when you'll think of me and smile
these days
everything seems to last only a while
remember the names
for the day when we'd have a child

but the trouble with dreams
they're not what they seem, 'cause when you awake
they fall through your fingers in flakes
they fall through your fingers in flakes
they fall through your fingers in flakes
they fall through your fingers in flakes

i'm not calling you a liar, just don't lie to me
i'm not calling you a thief, just don't steal from me
i'm not calling you a ghost, just stop haunting me
and i love you so much, i'm going to let you kill me


there's a ghost in my lungs and it sighs in my sleep
wraps itself around my tongue as it softly speaks
then it walks, then it walks with my legs
to fall, to fall, to fall at your feet


there but for the grace of god, i go
and when you kiss me, i am happy enough to die


i'm not calling you a liar, just don't lie to me
i'm not calling you a thief, just don't steal from me
i'm not calling you a ghost, just stop haunting me
and i love you so much, i'm going to let you kill me


there's a ghost in my lungs and it sighs in my sleep
wraps itself around my tongue as it softly speaks
then it walks, then it walks with my legs
to fall, to fall, to fall at your feet


to fall, to fall, to fall, to fall
to fall, to fall, at your feet


there but for the grace of god, i go
and when you kiss me, i am happy enough to die

she told me not to step on the cracks
i told her not to fuss and relax
well, her pretty little face stopped me in my tracks


but now she sleeps with one eye open
that's the price she'll pay


i took a knife and cut out her eye
i took it home and watched it wither and die
well, she's lucky that i didn't slip her a smile


that’s why she sleeps with one eye open, oh
that's the price she'll pay


i said, hey, girl with one eye
get your filthy fingers out of my pie
i said, hey, girl with one eye
i'll cut your little heart out ‘cause you made me cry


i slipped my hand under her skirt
i said don't worry, it's not gonna hurt
oh, my reputation's kind of clouded with dirt


that’s why you sleep with one eye open
that's the price she'll pay


i said, hey, girl with one eye
get your filthy fingers out of my pie
i said, hey, girl with one eye
i'll cut your little heart out ‘cause you made me cry


you made me cry
you made me cry
you made me cry


i said, hey, girl with one eye
get your filthy fingers out of my pie
i said, girl with one eye
get your filthy fingers out of my pie
i said, hey, girl with one eye
get your filthy fingers out of my pie
and i said, hey, girl with one eye
i'll cut your little heart out ‘cause you made me cry

i'm sorry i ruined your birthday
i guess i could go back to university
try and make my mother proud
stop this phase i'm in, she deems dangerous  and loud
the spelling is a problem
as is the discipline
and i don't think it would be too long
before i was drunk in camberwell again


this is the only thing i've ever had any faith in


grace, i know you carry us
grace, and it was such a mess
grace, i don't say it enough
grace, you are so loved


i'm sorry i ruined your birthday, you had turned 18
and the sunshine hit me and i was behaving strangely
all the walls were melting and there were mermaids everywhere
hearts flew from my hands, and i could see people's feelings


this is the only thing i've ever had any faith in


grace, i know you carry us
grace, and it was such a mess
grace, i don't say it enough
grace, you are so loved


and you, you were the one i treated the worst
only because you loved me the most
we haven't spoken in a long time
i think about it sometimes
i don't know who i was back then
and i hope on hope (hope on hope)
i would never treat anyone like that again


this is the only thing i've ever had any faith in


grace, i know you carry us
grace, and it was such a mess
grace, i don't say it enough
grace, you are so loved


grace, i know you carry us
grace, and it was such a fucking mess
grace, i don't say it enough
grace, you are so loved


this is the only thing i've ever had any faith in
(tell me what i can do, i will make it up to you)
this is the only thing i've ever had any faith in
(tell me what i can do, i will make it up to you)
this is the only thing i've ever had any faith in
this is the only thing i've ever had any faith in

remember those walls i built
well, baby they're tumbling down
they didn't even put up a fight
they didn't even make a sound

i found a way to let you in
but i never really had a doubt
standing in the light of your halo
i got my angel now


it's like i've been awakened
every rule i had you breaking
it's the risk that i'm taking
i ain't never gonna shut you out


everywhere i'm looking now
i'm surrounded by your embrace
baby i can see your halo
you know you're my saving grace


you're everything i need and more
it's written all over your face
standing in the light of your halo
pray it won't fade away
halo 


hit me like a ray of sun
shining through my darkest nights
you're the only thing that i want
and i'm addicted to your light

i swore i'd never fall again
but this don't even feel like falling
gravity can't forget
to pull me back to the ground again












i can see your halo, halo, halo 

there is love in your body but you can't hold it in
it pours from your eyes and spills from your skin
tenderest touch leaves the darkest of marks
and the kindest of kisses break the hardest of hearts


the hardest of hearts
the hardest of hearts
the hardest of hearts


there is love in your body but you can't get it out
it gets stuck in your head, won't come out of your mouth
sticks to your tongue and shows on your face
that the sweetest of words have the bitterest taste


darling heart, i loved you from the start
but you'll never know what a fool i've been
darling heart, i loved you from the start
but that's no excuse for the state i'm in


the hardest of hearts
the hardest of hearts
the hardest of hearts


there is love in our bodies and it holds us together
but pulls us apart when we're holding each other
we all want something to hold in the night
we don't care if it hurts when we're holding too tight


there is love in your body but you can't get it out
it gets stuck in your head, won't come out of your mouth
sticks to your tongue and shows on your face
that the sweetest of words have the bitterest taste


darling heart, i loved you from the start
but you'll never know what a fool i've been
darling heart, i loved you from the start
but that's no excuse for the state i'm in


the hardest of hearts
the hardest of hearts
the hardest of hearts


my heart swells like the water at wait
can't stop myself before it's too late
hold on to your heart
because i'm coming to take you
hold on to your heart
because i'm coming to break you


hold on, hold on (the hardest of hearts)
hold on, hold on (the hardest of hearts)
hold on, hold on (the hardest of hearts)
hold on, hold on


the hardest of hearts (hold on, hold on)
the hardest of hearts (hold on, hold on )
the hardest of hearts (hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on)

my heart is like a haunted house
there's things in there that scratch about
they make their music in the night
and in the day they give me such a fright


my heart is like a haunted house
there's things in there that scream and shout
they make their music in the night
wish i could find a way to let them out, oh


do you remember winding your arm around my shoulder
as we wandered 'round the hill?
now i'm in that fog forever
in full collaboration with the weather 'cause


i'm not free yet (ooh, ooh, ooh)
i'm not free yet (ooh, ooh, ooh)
i'm not free yet (ooh, ooh, ooh)
i'm not free yet (ooh, ooh, ooh)
i'm not free yet (ooh, ooh, ooh)
i'm not free yet (ooh, ooh, ooh)
i'm not free yet (ooh, ooh, ooh)
i'm not free yet


my heart is like a haunted house
there's things in there that scratch about
they make their music in the night
and in the day they give me such a fright

oh, the river, oh, the river, it's running free
and oh, the joy, oh, the joy it brings to me
but i know it'll have to drown me
before it can breathe easy
and i've seen it in the flights of birds
i've seen it in you
in the entrails of the animals
the blood running through
but in order to get to the heart
i think sometimes, you have to cut through


but you can, you can
we can, we can


just keep following the heartlines on your hand
just keep following the heartlines on your hand
keep it up, i know you can
just keep following the heartlines on your hand
'cause i am


odyssey on odyssey, and land over land
creeping and crawling like the sea over sand
still, i follow heartlines on your hand
and this fantasy, this fallacy, this tumbling stone
echoes of a city that's long overgrown
your heart is the only place that i call home
can i be returned?


you can, you can
we can


just keep following the heartlines on your hand
just keep following the heartlines on your hand
keep it up, i know you can
just keep following the heartlines on your hand


what a thing to do
oh, whoa, what a thing to choose
but know, in some way, i'm there with you
up against the wall on a wednesday afternoon


just keep following the heartlines on your hand
just keep following the heartlines on your hand
keep it up, i know you can
just keep following the heartlines on your hand
'cause i am

i was a heavy heart to carry
my beloved was weighed down
my arms around his neck
my fingers laced to crown
i was a heavy heart to carry
my feet dragged across the ground
and he took me to the river
where he slowly let me drown


my love has concrete feet
my love's an iron ball
wrapped around your ankles
over the waterfall


i'm so heavy, heavy
heavy in your arms
i'm so heavy, heavy
heavy in your arms


and is it worth the wait
all this killing time?
are you strong enough to stand
protecting both your heart and mine?
who is the betrayer?
who's the killer in the crowd?
the one who creeps in corridors
and doesn't make a sound


my love has concrete feet
my love's an iron ball
wrapped around your ankles
over the waterfall
my love has concrete feet
my love's an iron ball
wrapped around your ankles
over the waterfall


i'm so heavy, heavy
heavy in your arms
i'm so heavy, heavy
heavy in your arms


this will be my last confession
i love you, never felt like any blessing, oh
whispering like it's a secret
only to condemn the one who hears it
with a heavy heart


whoa (heavy)
heavy, heavy
i'm so heavy in your arms
(i'm so heavy)
heavy, heavy
i'm so heavy in your arms
(i'm so heavy)
heavy, heavy
i'm so heavy in your arms
(i'm so heavy)
heavy, heavy
i'm so heavy in your arms


i was a heavy heart to carry
my beloved was weighed down
my arms around his neck
my fingers laced to crown
i was a heavy heart to carry
but he never let me down
when he had me in his arms
my feet never touched the ground


i'm so heavy
heavy in your arms
heavy, i'm so heavy in your arms

i think you hide
when all the world's asleep and tired
you cry a little, so do i, so do i
i think you hide
and you don't have to tell me why
you cry a little, so do i, so do i


tell me i will be released
not sure i can deal with this
up all night again this week
breaking things that i should keep


i know that you're hiding
i know there's a part of you that i just cannot reach
you don't have to let me in
just know that i'm still here
i'm ready for you whenever, whenever you need
whenever you want to begin


i know you've tried
but something stops you every time
you cry a little, so do i, so do i
and it's your pride
that's keeping us still so far apart
but if you give a little, so will i, so will i


tell me i will be released
not sure i can deal with this
up all night again this week
breaking things that i should keep


i know that you're hiding
i know there's a part of you that i just cannot reach
you don't have to let me in
just know that i'm still here
i'm ready for you whenever, whenever you need
whenever you want to begin


i know i seem shaky
these hands not fit for holding
but if you let me, oh
i will see you right


tell me i will be released
not sure i can deal with this
up all night again this week
breaking things that i should keep


tell me i will be released
not sure i can deal with this (i should keep)
up all night again this week (i should)
breaking things that i should keep


tell me i will be released
not sure i can deal with this (i should keep)
up all night again this week
breaking things that i should keep


i know that you're hiding
i know there's a part of you that i just cannot reach
you don't have to let me in
just know that i'm still here
i'm ready for you whenever, whenever you need
whenever you want to begin


i'm still here
i'm still here

there's nothing to do here
all just lie and complain
in bed at the hospital
coming and going
asleep and awake
in bed at the hospital


i've got one friend
laying across from me
i did not choose him
he did not choose me
we have no chance
of recovering
laying in hospitals
joy and misery
joy and misery
joy and misery


put out the fire boys
don't stop, don't stop
put out the fire on us
put out the fire boys
don't stop, don't stop
put out the fire on us


bring your buckets by the dozen
bring your nieces and your cousins
oh, put out the fire on us
bring your buckets by the dozen
bring your nieces and your cousins
oh, put out the fire on us


i've got one friend
laying across from me
i did not choose him
he did not choose me
we have no chance
of recovering
laying in hospitals
joy and misery
joy and misery
joy and misery

if you could only see the beast you've made of me
i held it in, but now it seems you've set it running free
screaming in the dark, i howl when we're apart
drag my teeth across your chest to taste your beating heart
my fingers claw your skin, try to tear my way in
you are the moon that breaks the night for which i have to howl
my fingers claw your skin, try to tear my way in
you are the moon that breaks the night for which i have to


howl, howl
howl, howl


now there's no holding back, i'm making to attack
my blood is singing with your voice, i want to pour it out
the saints can't help me now, the ropes have been unbound
i hunt for you with bloody feet across the hallowed ground
like some child, possessed, the beast howls in my veins
i want to find you, tear out all your tenderness


howl, howl
howl, howl


be careful of the curse that falls on young lovers
starts so soft and sweet, and turns them to hunters


(hunters, hunters)
(hunters, hunters)
(hunters, hunters)
(hunters, hunters)


the fabric of your flesh, pure as a wedding dress
until i wrap myself inside your arms, i cannot rest
the saints can't help me now, the ropes have been unbound
i hunt for you with bloody feet across the hallowed ground
and howl


be careful of the curse that falls on young lovers
starts so soft and sweet, and turns them to hunters


a man who's pure of heart and says his prayers by night
may still become a wolf when the autumn moon is bright


if you could only see the beast you've made of me
i held it in, but now it seems you've set it running free
the saints can't help me now, the ropes have been unbound
i hunt for you with bloody feet across the hallowed ground

ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh


at seventeen i started to starve myself
i thought that love was a kind of emptiness
and at least i understood then the hunger i felt
and i didn't have to call it loneliness


we all have a hunger
we all have a hunger
we all have a hunger
we all have a hunger


tell me what you need
oh, you look so free
the way you use your body, baby
come on and work it for me
don't let them get you down
you're the best thing i've seen
we never found the answer
but we knew one thing


we all have a hunger
(we all have a hunger)
we all have a hunger
(we all have a hunger)
we all have a hunger
(we all have a hunger)
we all have a hunger
(we all have a hunger)


and it's friday night and it's kicking in
in that pink dress, they're gonna crucify me
oh and you in all your vibrant youth
how could anything bad ever happen to you?
you make a fool of death with your beauty
and for a moment


i thought that love was in the drugs
but the more i took, the more it took away
and i could never get enough
i thought that love was on the stage, give yourself to strangers
you don't have to be afraid
then it tries to find a home
with people or when i'm alone
picking it apart
and staring at your phone


we all have a hunger
we all have a hunger
we all have a hunger
we all have a hunger


tell me what you need
oh, you look so free
the way you use your body, baby
come on and work it for me
don't let them get you down
you're the best thing i've seen
we never found the answer
but we knew one thing


we all have a hunger
(we all have a hunger)
we all have a hunger
(we all have a hunger)
we all have a hunger
(we all have a hunger)
we all have a hunger
(we all have a hunger)


and it's friday night and it's kicking in
in that pink dress, they're gonna crucify me
oh and you in all your vibrant youth
how could anything bad ever happen to you?
you make a fool of death with your beauty
and for a moment i forget to worry

no walls can keep me protected
no sleep, nothing in between me and the rain
and you can't save me now
i'm in the grip of a hurricane
i'm going to blow myself away


i'm going out, i'm going to drink myself to death
and in the crowd, i see you with someone else
i brace myself, because i know it's going to hurt
but i like to think at least things can't get any worse


no home, i don't want shelter
no calm, nothing to keep me from the storm
and you can't hold me down
because i belong to the hurricane
it's going to blow us all away


i'm going out, i'm going to drink myself to death
and in the crowd, i see you with someone else
i brace myself, because i know it's going to hurt
but i like to think at least things can't get any worse


i hope that you see me, because i'm staring at you
but when you look over, you look right through
then you lean and kiss her on the head
and i never felt so alive, and so dead


i'm going out, i'm going to drink myself to death
and in the crowd, i see you with someone else
i brace myself, because i know it's going to hurt
i'm going out...
i'm going out, i'm going to drink myself to death
and in the crowd, i see you with someone else
i brace myself, because i know it's going to hurt
i'm going out
i'm going out
i'm going out
i'm going out
i'm going out

i love you all the time
oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh
oh oh, oh oh, ah


i'm never alone, i look at my phone
if i call you up, you're never at home
i love you all the time
i'm fueled up and high, i'm out with the guys
a smile on my face, no reason to cry
i love you all the time


i can tell by that look in your eye
you're looking and all you see's another guy
i can tell you're going to take your love away
i can tell by that look in your eye
you're looking and all you see's another guy
i would beg you if i thought it would make you stay


ce soir c’est le soir
et toi avec moi
et tu viens me voir
tu viens, oh la la
i love you all the time
tu ne réponds pas
ah dites-moi pourquoi
just say au revoir
again me voilà
i love you all the time


and i can tell by that look in your eye
you're looking and all you see's another guy
i can tell you're going to take your love away
i can tell by that look in your eye
you're looking and all you see's another guy
i would beg if i thought it would make you stay
i would beg if i thought it would make you stay
i would beg if i thought it would make you stay

i'm not calling you a thief
just don't steal from me
i'm not calling you a ghost
just stop haunting me
and i love you so much
i'm going to let you kill me


there's a ghost in my lungs
and it sighs in my sleep
wraps itself around my tongue
as it softly speaks
then it walks, then it walks
with my legs
to fall, to fall
to fall, at your feet


there but for the grace of god go i
and when you kiss me i'm happy enough to die


i'm not calling you a liar
just don't lie to me
and i love you so much
i'm going to let you (kill me)
i'm not calling you a thief
just stop—
and i love you so much
i'm going to let you—
i'm not calling you a ghost
just stop—


there's a ghost in my mouth
and it talks in my sleep
wraps itself around my tongue
as it softly speaks
then it walks, then it walks
then it walks, with my legs
to fall, to fall, to fall, to fall
to fall, to fall—
to fall, to fall, to fall, to fall
to fall, to fall, at your feet


there but for the grace of god go i
and when you kiss me i'm happy enough—

high in the halls of the kings who are gone
jenny would dance with her ghosts
the ones she had lost and the ones she had found
and the ones who had loved her the most


the ones who'd been gone for so very long
she couldn't remember their names
they spun her around on the damp old stone
spun away all her sorrow and pain


and she never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave
never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave


they danced through the day and into the night
through the snow that swept through the hall
from winter to summer and winter again
'til the walls did crumble and fall


and she never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave
never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave
and she never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave
never wanted to leave, never wanted to leave


high in the halls of the kings who are gone
jenny would dance with her ghosts
the ones she had lost and the ones she had found
and the ones who had loved her the most

the show was ending and i had started to crack
woke up in chicago when the sky turned black
and you're so high, you're so high, you have to be an angel
and i'm so high, i'm so high, i can see an angel


i hear your heart beating in your chest
the world slows till there's nothing left
skyscrapers look on like great, unblinking giants
in those heavy days in june
when love became an act of defiance


hold on to each other
hold on to each other
hold on to each other
hold on to each other


and you were broken-hearted
and the world was too
and i was beginning to lose my grip
and i have always held it loosely
but this time i admit
i felt it really start to slip
and choirs sing in the street
and i would come to you
to watch the television screen
in your hotel room
i'm always down to hide with you


hold on to each other
hold on to each other
hold on to each other
hold on to each other


you're so high, you're so high
you're so high, you're so high
you're so high, you're so high
you have to be an angel
and i'm so high, i'm so high
i'm so high, i'm so high
i'm so high, i'm so high
i can see an angel

you hit me once
i hit you back
you gave a kick
i gave a slap
you smashed a plate
over my head
then i set fire to our bed


you hit me once
i hit you back
you gave a kick
i gave a slap
you smashed a plate
over my head
then i set fire to our bed


my black eye casts no shadow
your red eye sees no blame
your slaps don't stick
your kicks don't hit
so we remain the same


blood sticks, sweat drips
break the lock if it don't fit
a kick in the teeth is good for some
a kiss with a fist is better than none
whoa, a kiss with a fist is better than none


broke your jaw once before
i spilled your blood upon the floor
you broke my leg in return
so let's sit back and watch the bed burn


blood sticks, sweat drips
break the lock if it don't fit
a kick in the teeth is good for some
a kiss with a fist is better than none
whoa, a kiss with a fist is better than none


you hit me once
i hit you back
you gave a kick
i gave a slap
you smashed a plate
over my head
then i set fire to our bed




you hit me once
i hit you back
you gave a kick
i gave a slap
you smashed a plate
over my head
then i set fire to our bed

ehh, oh ohh
ehh, oh ohh
ehh, oh ohh
ehh, oh ohh


she can't see the landscape anymore
it's all painted in her grief
all of her history etched out at her feet

now all of the landscape, it's just an empty place
acres of longing, mountains of tenderness


'cause she's just like the weather, can't hold her together
born from dark water, daughter of the rain and snow
because it's burning through the bloodline
it's cutting down the family tree
growing in the landscape, darling, in between you and me


she wants the silence, but fears the solitude
she wants to be alone and together with you
so she ran to the lighthouse, hoped that it would help her see
she saw that the lighthouse had been washed out to sea


'cause she's just like the weather, can't hold her together
born from dark water, daughter of the rain and snow
because it's burning through the bloodline
it's cutting down the family tree
growing in the landscape, darling, in between you and me


i want to give you back the open sky
give you back the open sea
open up the ages, darling, for you to see


you put the gun into your mouth to bite
the bullet and spit it out
because it's running in the family
all the rituals between you and me


'cause she's just like the weather, can't hold her together
born from dark water, daughter of the rain and snow
because it's burning through the bloodline
it's cutting down the family tree
growing in the landscape, darling, in between you and me

i'm going to be released from behind these lines
and i don't care whether i live or die
and i'm losing blood, i'm gonna leave my bones
and i don't want your heart, it leaves me cold


i don't want your future
i don't need your past
one bright moment
is all i ask


i'm going to leave my body
(moving up to higher ground)
i'm going to lose my mind
(your history keeps pulling me down)
said i'm going to leave my body
(moving up to higher ground)
i'm going to lose my mind
(your history keeps pulling me, pulling me down)


i don't need a husband, don't need no wife
and don't need the day, i don't need the night
and i don't need the birds, let them fly away
and i don't want the clouds, they never seem to stay


i don't want no future
i don't need no past
one bright moment
is all i ask

i don't want your future
i don't need your past
one bright moment
is all i ask, and i-


i'm going to leave my body
(moving up to higher ground)
i'm going to lose my mind
(your history keeps pulling me down)
said i'm going to leave my body
(moving up to higher ground)
i'm going to lose my mind
(your history keeps pulling me, pulling me down)


pulling me down
pulling me down
pulling me down
pulling me down


i'm going to leave my body
(moving up to higher ground)
i'm going to lose my mind
(your history keeps pulling me down)
said i'm going to leave my body
(moving up to higher ground)
i'm going to lose my mind
(your history keeps pulling me, pulling me down)

i'm going to leave my body
(moving up to higher ground)
i'm going to lose my mind
(your history keeps pulling me down)
said i'm going to leave my body
(moving up to higher ground)
i'm going to lose my mind
(your history keeps pulling me, pulling me down)
don't go blindly in the dark
every one of us shines the light of love

lost in the fog, these hollow hills
blood running hot, night chills
without your love, i'll be
so long and lost, are you missing me?


is it too late to come on home?
are all those bridges now old stone?
is it too late to come on home?
can the city forgive? i hear its sad song


i need the clouds to cover me
pulling them down, surround me
without your love i'll be
so long and lost, are you missing me?


is it too late to come on home?
are all those bridges now old stone?
is it too late to come on home?
can the city forgive? i hear its sad song


it's been so long between the words we spoke
will you be there up on the shore, i hope
you wonder why it is that i came home
i figured out where i belong


but it's too late to come on home
are all those bridges now old stone?
but it's too late to come on home
can the city forgive? i hear its sad song

i've been losing sleep
i've been keeping myself awake
i've been wandering the streets
for days and days and days


i'm going from road to road
bed to bed
lover to lover
and black to red
but i believe
i believe


there's no salvation for me now
no space among the clouds
and i feel i'm heading down
but that's alright
that's alright
that's alright
that's alright
that's alright


and i've been taking chances
i've been setting myself up for the fall
i've been keeping secrets
from my heart and from my soul


i'm going from road to road
bed to bed
lover to lover
and black to red
but i believe
i believe


there's no salvation for me now
no space among the clouds
and i feel i'm heading down
but that's alright
that's alright
that's alright
that's alright


road to road, bed to bed
and lover to lover and black to red
and road to road, bed to bed
and lover to lover


no space among the clouds
and i feel i'm heading down
that's alright
that's alright
that's alright
that's alright
that's alright
that's alright


road to road, bed to bed
and lover to lover and black to red
and road to road, bed to bed
lover to lover, to lover, to lover, to lover, to lover, to lover, to lover, to lover, to lover, to lover, to lover


no salvation for me now
no salvation for me now
no salvation for me now
no salvation for me now

i never thought i'd be a killer
'cause there's so much to lose
but if i can't drink the water
what else can i do?

and although the axe is heavy
it just sits in my hands
while you're changing like the current
not a shore on land


every time i try to bring it down
you always turn my hand around


make up your mind (make up, make up)
let me live or let me love you
while you've been saving your neck (make up, make up)
i've been breaking mine for you
the power is on, the guillotine hums
my back's to the wall, go on, let it fall, oh
make up your mind (make up, make up)
before i make it up for you


i never thought that i'd be facing
a sea that's bluer than the tide
now my knees are shaking
and i can't look in your eyes

but if you're gonna make me do it
how'd you want it done?
is it best to sip it slowly
or drink it down in one?


every time i try to bring it down
you always turn my hand around


make up your mind (make up, make up)
let me live or let me love you
while you've been saving your neck (make up, make up)
i've been breaking mine for you
the power is on, the guillotine hums
my back's to the wall, go on, let it fall, oh
make up your mind (make up, make up)
before i make it up for you


the executioner's within me
and he comes, blindfold ready
sword in hand
and arms so steady
every time i try to bring it down
you always turn my hand around
but every time i try to bring it down
you always turn my hand around


make up your mind (make up, make up)
let me live or let me love you
while you've been saving your neck (make up, make up)
i've been breaking mine for you
the power is on, the guillotine hums
my back's to the wall, go on, let it fall, oh
make up your mind (make up, make up)
before i make it up for you

make up your mind (make up, make up)
let me live or let me love you (let me love you)
while you've been saving your neck (make up, make up)
i've been breaking mine for you
(i've been breaking...)
the power is on, the guillotine hums
(i've been breaking...)
my back's to the wall, go on, let it fall, oh
(i've been breaking...)
make up your mind
(i've been breaking, i've been breaking...)
before i make it up for you

want me to love you in moderation
do i look moderate to you?
sip it slowly and pay attention
i just have to see it through
you got me looking for validation
pastures new
want me to love you in moderation
well, who do you think you're talking to?


then bow your head in the house of god
and little girl, who do you think you are?
you think you need it, you think you want love
you wouldn't want it if you knew what it was
moderation
moderation
moderation (ooh)


i never made it with moderation
no, i never understood
all the feeling was all or nothing
and i took everything i could
can't hold it back, i can't take the tension
oh, i'm trying to be good
want me to love you in moderation
well don't you know, i wish i could


then bow your head in the house of god
and little girl, who do you think you are?
you think you need it, you think you want love
you wouldn't want it if you knew what it was
moderation
moderation
moderation


girl, you better learn (i just can't win)
how to hold it in (can't hold it in)
and girl, you better learn (i just can't win)
i just can't win (can't hold it in)
'cause i don't see the worth (i just can't win)
i don't see the worth
and i'm still tryna figure out if it
always, always, always has to hurt


(ah, ah, ah)


you want love
moderation
moderation

oh lord, won't you leave me
leave me on my knees?
'cause i belong to the ground now
and it belongs to me
and oh lord, won't you leave me
leave me just like this?
'cause i belong to the ground now
i want no more than this


how long for the autumn
the sun keeps burning me
every stone in this city keeps reminding me, oh
can you protect me from what i want?
a lover i let in left me so lost


mother, make me
make me a big tall tree
so i can shed my leaves and let it blow through me
mother, make me
make me a big grey cloud
so i can rain on you things i can't say out loud


all these couples are kissing
and i can't stand the heat
i lost my shoes and left the party
i wandered in the street

i put my feet into the fountain
the statues all asleep
no use wishing on the water
won't bring you no release


mother, make me
make me a bird of prey
so i can rise above this, let it fall away
mother, make me
make me a song so sweet
heaven trembles, fallen at our feet


oh lord, won't you leave me
leave me on my knees?
'cause i belong to the ground now
and it belongs to me
and oh lord, won't you leave me
leave me just like this?
'cause i belong to the ground now
i want no more than this

oh lord, won't you leave me
leave me on my knees?
'cause i belong to the ground now
and it belongs to me
and oh lord, won't you leave me
leave me just like this?
'cause i belong to the ground now
i want no more than this

when your life is over
i won't be sad or blue
i'll put on my fancy hat
lie down next to you


i'll kiss you once for life
i'll kiss you twice for death
hold you close for comfort
wearing my best dress


you look so angry when you sleep
your face a troubled frown
so i will smooth your furrowed brow
as i lay you in the ground


i'll kiss you once for life
i'll kiss you twice for death
hold you close for comfort
wearing my best dress


and as the mourners pass me
i will smile and wave
thank them for their sympathy
and tell them i'll be brave
but once the wake is over
and i'm drunk and feeling fine
i'll go out there and find me
another boy to pass the time

as we're dancing cheek to cheek
and the lights are laid low
i'll request this song for you
laying in the ground below
once the song is over
and it's time to go to bed
i'll leave him on the dance floor
and return to you instead


i'll kiss you once for life
i'll kiss you twice for death
hold you close for comfort
wearing my best dress

my boy builds coffins with hammers and nails
he doesn't build ships, he has no use for sails
he doesn't make tables, dressers or chairs
he can't carve a whistle because he just doesn't care

my boy builds coffins for the rich and the poor
kings and queens, they've all knocked on his door
beggars and liars, gypsies and thieves
they all come to him because he's so eager to please


my boy builds coffins, he makes them all day
but it's not just for work and it isn't for play
he's made one for himself
one for me too
one of these days he'll make one for you
for you, for you, for you


my boy builds coffins for better or worse
some say its a blessing, some say its a curse
he fits them together in sunshine or rain
each one is unique, no two are the same

my boy builds coffins and i think it's a shame
that when each one's been made, he can't see it again
he crafts everyone with love and with care
then it's thrown in the ground, it just isn't fair


my boy builds coffins, he makes them all day
but it's not just for work and it isn't for play
he's made one for himself
one for me too
one of these days he'll make one for you
for you, for you, for you

looking up from underneath
fractured moonlight on the sea
reflections still look the same to me
as before i went under

and it's peaceful in the deep
cathedral where you cannot breathe
no need to pray, no need to speak
now i am under all


and it's breaking over me
a thousand miles down to the sea bed
found the place to rest my head
never let me go, never let me go
never let me go, never let me go


and the arms of the ocean are carrying me
and all this devotion was rushing out of me
and the crashes are heaven, for a sinner like me
but the arms of the ocean delivered me


though the pressure's hard to take
it's the only way i can escape
it seems a heavy choice to make
and now i am under, oh


and it's breaking over me
a thousand miles down to the sea bed
found the place to rest my head
never let me go, never let me go
never let me go, never let me go


and the arms of the ocean are carrying me
and all this devotion was rushing out of me
and the crashes are heaven, for a sinner like me
but the arms of the ocean delivered me


and it's over and i'm going under
but i'm not giving up, i'm just giving in
i'm slipping underneath
so cold and so sweet

and the arms of the ocean so sweet and so cold
and all this devotion i never knew at all
and the crashes are heaven for a sinner released
and the arms of the ocean delivered me


never let me go, never let me go
never let me go, never let me go
delivered me
never let me go, never let me go
never let me go, never let me go
delivered me
never let me go, never let me go
never let me go, never let me go
delivered me
never let me go, never let me go
never let me go, never let me go

and it's over and i'm going under
but i'm not giving up, i'm just giving in
i'm slipping underneath
so cold and so sweet

and it's hard to write about being happy
'cause the older i get
i find that happiness is an extremely uneventful subject


and there would be no grand choirs to sing
no chorus could come in
about two people sitting doing nothing


but i must confess
i did it all for myself
i gathered you here to hide from some vast unnameable fear
but the loneliness never left me
i always took it with me
but i can put it down in the pleasure of your company


and there will be no grand choirs to sing
no chorus will come in
and no ballad will be written
it will be entirely forgotten


and if tomorrow it's all over
at least we had it for a moment
oh, darling, things seem so unstable
but for a moment we were able to be still


and there will be no grand choirs to sing
no chorus will come in
no ballad will be written
this will be entirely forgotten



you are the hole in my head
you are the space in my bed
you are the silence in between
what i thought and what i said
you are the night-time fear
you are the morning when it's clear
when it's over, you're the start
you're my head and you're my heart


no light, no light
in your bright blue eyes
i never knew daylight could be so violent
a revelation in the light of day
you can't choose what stays and what fades away
and i'd do anything to make you stay
no light, no light
tell me what you want me to say


through the crowd i was crying out and
in your place there were a thousand other faces
i was disappearing in plain sight
heaven help me, i need to make it right


you want a revelation
you want to get right
but it's a conversation
i just can't have tonight
you want a revelation
some kind of resolution
you want a revelation


no light, no light
in your bright blue eyes
i never knew daylight could be so violent
a revelation in the light of day
you can't choose what stays and what fades away
and i'd do anything to make you stay
no light, no light
tell me what you want me to say


would you leave me
if i told you what i've done?
and would you leave me
if i told you what i've become?
because it's so easy
to say it to a crowd
but it's so hard, my love
to say it to you out loud


no light, no light
in your bright blue eyes
i never knew daylight could be so violent
a revelation in the light of day
you can't choose what stays and what fades away
and i'd do anything to make you stay
no light, no light
tell me what you want me to say


you want a revelation
you want to get right
but it's a conversation
i just can't have tonight
you want a revelation
some kind of resolution
you want a revelation

you want a revelation
you want to get right
but it's a conversation
i just can't have tonight
you want a revelation
some kind of resolution
tell me what you want me to say
i'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be
you're gonna give your love to me
i wanna love you night and day
you know my loving won't fade away
you know my love, not fade away

my love is bigger than a cadillac
i try to show you and you drive me back
your love for me got to be real
for you to know just how i feel
a love for real, not fade away
yes, a love for real, not fade away

i'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be
you're gonna give your love to me
a love to last more than one day
'cause a love for real won't fade away
a love that's love and not fade away

i'm gonna show you how it's gonna be
you're gonna give your love to me
a love to last more than one day
'cause a love is love, not fade away
a love is love, not fade away
'cause a love is love, not fade away

a love is love, not fade away
love is love, love is love
love is love, not fade away
love is love, not, love is love, not
love is love, not fade away
oh, darling
please believe me
i'll never do you no harm
believe me when i tell you
i'll never do you no harm

oh, darling
if you leave me
i'll never make it alone
believe me when i beg you—ooh!
don't ever leave me alone

when you told me
you didn't need me any more
well, you know, i nearly
broke down and cried
when you told me
you didn't need me any more
well, you know, i nearly
broke down and died

oh, darling
if you leave me
i'll never make it alone
believe me when i tell you
i'll never do you no harm

spoken:
believe me, darling

when you told me (whoo)
you didn't need me any more
well, you know, i nearly
broke down and cried
when you told me
you didn't need me any more
well, you know, i nearly
broke down and died

oh, darling
please believe me
i'll never let you down
(spoken) oh, believe me, darling
believe me when i tell you—whoo!
i'll never do you no harm

and i had a dream
about my old school
and she was there all pink and gold and glittering
i threw my arms around her legs
came to weeping (came to weeping)
came to weeping (came to weeping)


and i heard your voice as clear as day
and you told me i should concentrate
it was all so strange and so surreal
that a ghost should be so practical
only if for a night


and the only solution was to stand and fight
and my body was loose and i was set alight
but you came over me like some holy rite
and although i was burning, you're the only light
only if for a night


and the grass was so green against my new clothes
and i did cartwheels in your honor
dancing on tiptoes
my own secret ceremonials
before the service began
in the graveyard doing handstands


and i heard your voice as clear as day
and you told me i should concentrate
it was all so strange and so surreal
that a ghost should be so practical
only if for a night


and the only solution was to stand and fight
and my body was loose and i was set alight
but you came over me like some holy rite
and although i was burning, you're the only light
only if for a night


my doe, my dear, my darling
tell me what all the sighing is about
tell me what all the sighing is about


and i heard your voice as clear as day
and you told me i should concentrate
it was all so strange and so surreal
that a ghost should be so practical


only if for a night (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
only if for a night (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
only if for a night (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
only if for a night (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
only if for a night (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
only if for a night (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
only if for a night (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
only if for a night (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

when you were young and on your own
how did it feel to be alone?
i was always thinking of games i should be playing
how to make the best of my time


'cause only love can break your heart
try to be sure right from the start
yes, only love can break your heart
what if your world should fall apart?


i have a friend i've never seen
he hides his head inside a dream
someone should call him and see if he can come out
try to lose the down that he's found


'cause only love can break your heart
try to be sure right from the start
yes, only love can break your heart
what if your world should fall apart?


i have a friend i've never seen
he hides his head inside a dream
only love can break your heart
yes, only love can break your heart

ever since i was a child
i've turned it over in my mind
i sang by the piano
tore my yellow dress and
cried and cried and cried


now to unsee what i've seen
to undo what has been done
turn off all the lights
let the morning come, come


now there's green light in my eyes
and my lover on my mind
and i sing from the piano
tear my yellow dress and
cry and cry and cry
over the love of you


all this champagne drunken home
against the current of gold
everybody see i love him
cause it's a feeling that you get
when the afternoon is set
on the bridge into the city


and now to unsee what i've seen
to undo what has been done
turn off all the lights
let the morning come


now there's green light in my eyes
and my lover on my mind
and i sing from the piano
tear my yellow dress and
cry and cry and cry


because you're a hard soul to save
with an ocean in my way
but i'll get around it, i'll get around it
cause you're a hard soul to save
with an ocean in the way
but i'll get around it


now there's green light in my eyes
and my lover on my mind
and i sing from the piano
tear my yellow dress and
cry and cry and cry
over the love of you


cry and cry and cry and
over the love of you
cry and cry and cry and
over the love of you
cry and cry and cry and
over the love of you
i can see the green light, i can see it in your eyes
i can see the green light, i can see it in your eyes
i can see the green light, i can see it in your eyes
i can see the green light, i can see it in your eyes
i can see the green light, i can see it in your eyes
we're paper dolls, all joined together
walking arm in arm
but each float like feathers
shaken by the storm


then everybody started tearing up when they pulled apart
everyone had broken arms and legs and broken hearts
everybody started tearing up and they pulled apart
everyone had broken arms and legs and broken hearts
like paper chains

paper dolls gonna let me die by knife
we stand in the line, hold on to life
we hate that we  the blinding light

oh patricia, you've always been my north star
and i have to tell you something
i'm still afraid of the dark
but you take my hand in your hand
from you the flowers grow
and do you understand with every seed you sow
you make this cold world beautiful?


you told me all doors are open to the believer
i believe her, i believe her, i believe her
you told me all doors are open to the believer
i believe her, i believe her, i believe her


oh patricia, you've always been my north star, oh
oh patricia, you've always been my north star, oh


well, you're a 'real man', and you do what you can
you only take as much as you can grab with two hands
with your big heart, you praise god above
but how's that working out for you, honey?
do you feel loved?


she told me all doors are open to the believer
i believe her, i believe her, i believe her
do you feel loved? do you feel loved?
she told me all doors are open to the believer
i believe her, i believe her, i believe her
do you feel loved?


oh patricia, you've always been my north star, oh
oh patricia, you've always been my north star, oh


i drink too much coffee and think of you often
in a city where reality has long been forgotten
and are you afraid? 'cause i'm terrified
but you remind me that it's such a wonderful thing to love
it's such a wonderful thing to love
it's such a wonderful thing to love
it's such a wonderful thing to love
it's such a wonderful thing
it's such a wonderful thing to love
it's such a wonderful thing to love
it's such a wonderful thing to love
it's such a wonderful thing to love
it's such a wonderful thing
the times we had
oh when the wind would blow with rain and snow
were not all bad
we put our feet just where they had, had to go
never to go, oh

the shattered soul
following close but nearly twice as slow
in my good times
there were always golden rocks to throw
at those who admit defeat too late
those were our times, those were our times, woah

and i will love to see that day
that day was mine
when she will marry me outside by the willow tree
and play the songs we made
they made me so
and i would love to see that day
her day was mine

blinded by the glare
i was moving like i didn't care
but it was more than i could bear
you know i hoped i'd see you there


staring out the window
i could see into the soul of every passer by
so many lives
so many pairs of eyes
a pure feeling
i'm invisible and magical
if only for a moment
a pure feeling
i'm scared to control it


stretching out my arms
i let it comfort me
our bodies moving in the dark
it takes the pain from me
and then i am in love
with everyone i see
i keep on moving in the spaces where you used to be


and the illusion starts to tear
let everybody stand and stare
cause now i have no fear
i knew that this would end in tears


staring out the window
i could see into the soul of every passer by
so many lives
so many pairs of eyes
a pure feeling
i'm invisible and magical
if only for a moment
a pure feeling
i'm scared to control it


stretching out my arms
i let it comfort me
our bodies moving in the dark
it takes the pain from me
and then i am in love
with everyone i see
i keep on moving in the spaces where you used to be


those strangers carry me
i'm lost; they're finding me
i'm gone; they're there with me
but it's not over
the spaces in between
they keep you far from me
the emptiness; it means it's not over


stretching out my arms
i let it comfort me
our bodies moving in the dark
it takes the pain from me
and then i am in love
with everyone i see
i keep on moving in the spaces where you used to be


stretching out my arms
i let it comfort me
our bodies moving in the dark
it takes the pain from me
and then i am in love
with everyone i see
i keep on moving in the spaces where you used to be

oh, the king
gone mad within his suffering
called out for release
someone cure him of his grief

his only son
cut down, but the battle won
oh, what is it worth
when all that's left is hurt?


like the stars chase the sun
over the glowing hill, i will conquer
blood is running deep
some things never sleep


suddenly i'm overcome
dissolving like the setting sun
like a boat into oblivion
'cause you're driving me away
now you have me on the run
the damage is already done
come on, is this what you want?
'cause you're driving me away


oh, the queen of peace
always does her best to please
but is it any use?
somebody's gotta lose

like a long scream
out there, always echoing
oh, what is it worth?
all that's left is hurt


like the stars chase the sun
over the glowing hill, i will conquer
blood is running deep
some things never sleep


suddenly i'm overcome
dissolving like the setting sun
like a boat into oblivion
'cause you're driving me away
now you have me on the run
the damage is already done
come on, is this what you want?
'cause you're driving me away


and my love is no good
against the fortress that it made of you
blood is running deep
sorrow that you keep


suddenly i'm overcome
dissolving like the setting sun
like a boat into oblivion
'cause you're driving me away
now you have me on the run
the damage is already done
come on, is this what you want?
'cause you're driving me away


to give yourself over to another body
that's all you want really
to be out of your own and consumed by another
to swim inside the skin of your lover
not to have to breathe, not to have to think
but you can't live on love; salt water's no drink

the looking glass, so shiny and new
how quickly the glamour fades
i start spinning, slipping out of time
was that the wrong pill to take? (raise it up)

you made a deal, and now it seems you have to offer up
but will it ever be enough? (raise it up, raise it up)
it's not enough (raise it up, raise it up)

here i am, a rabbit-hearted girl
frozen in the headlights
it seems i've made the final sacrifice


we raise it up, this offering
we raise it up


this is a gift, it comes with a price
who is the lamb and who is the knife?
midas is king and he holds me so tight
and turns me to gold in the sunlight


i look around, but i can't find you (raise it up)
if only i could see your face (raise it up)
instead of rushing towards the skyline (raise it up)
i wish that i could just be brave

i must become a lion-hearted girl
ready for a fight
before i make the final sacrifice


we raise it up, this offering
we raise it up


this is a gift, it comes with a price
who is the lamb and who is the knife?
midas is king and he holds me so tight
and turns me to gold in the sunlight


raise it up, raise it up
raise it up, raise it up
and in the spring i shed my skin
and it blows away with the changing wind
the waters turn from blue to red
as towards the sky i offer it


this is a gift, it comes with a price
who is the lamb and who is the knife?
midas is king and he holds me so tight
and turns me to gold in the sunlight


this is a gift, it comes with a price
who is the lamb and who is the knife?
midas is king and he holds me so tight
and turns me to gold in the sunlight


this is a gift, it comes with a price
who is the lamb and who is the knife?
midas is king and he holds me so tight
and turns me to gold in the sunlight


this is a gift

i was born in a big grey cloud
screaming out a love song
all the broken chords and unnamed cries
what a place to come from

i wish to remain nameless
and live without shame
because what's in a name, oh
i still remain the same

you can call it what you want
you can call me anything you want
you can call us what you want
you can call me anything you want
everybody lets you down
in this free fall of a town
all the different souls rushing out
tell me what you're running from

i know everybody lets you down
and i'll do the same
but know i'll always be around
this can remain the same




call me when you need me (call me when you need me)
call me anything you want (call me when you need me)
darling believe me (darling believe me)
nothing i haven't done before

and i'll be dead before the day is done
before the day is done


and now all your love will be exorcised
and we will find new saints to be canonised
and it's an evensong, it's a litany
it's a battle cry, it's a symphony


seven devils all around you
seven devils in my house
see, they were there when i woke up this morning
i'll be dead before the day is done

before the day is done


you can keep me out
'til i tear the walls
to devastate your heart
and to take your soul
for what has been done
cannot be undone
in the eagle's eye
in the evensong


seven devils all around you
seven devils in your house
see, i was dead when i woke up this morning
i'll be dead before the day is done
before the day is done

regrets collect like old friends

(shake him off)
it's always darkest before the dawn
ooh whoa, ooh whoa


and i'm damned if i do and i'm damned if i don't
so here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my rope
and i'm ready to suffer and i'm ready to hope

'cause looking for heaven, found the devil in me (whoa)

don't touch the sleeping pills, they mess with my head
dredging up great white sharks, swimming in the bed
and here comes a killer whale, to sing me to sleep
thrashing the covers off, has me by its teeth


and, ah, my love remind me, what was it that i said?
i can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed
and, ah, my love remind me, what was it that i did?
did i drink too much? am i losing touch?
did i build a ship to wreck?


to wreck, to wreck, to wreck
did i build this ship to wreck?


what's with the long face? do you want more?
thousands of red-eyed mice, scratching at the door
and don't let the curtain catch you, cause you've been here before
the chair is an island, darling, you can't touch the floor


and, ah, my love remind me, what was it that i said?
i can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed
and, ah, my love remind me, what was it that i did?
did i drink too much? am i losing touch?
did i build a ship to wreck?


to wreck, to wreck, to wreck
did i build this ship to wreck?


good god, under starless skies
we are lost, and into the breach, we got tossed
and the water's coming in fast


and, ah, my love remind me, what was it that i said?
i can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed
and, ah, my love remind me, what was it that i did?
did i drink too much? am i losing touch?
did i build a ship to wreck?


to wreck, to wreck, to wreck
did i build this ship to wreck?
to wreck, to wreck, to wreck
did i build this ship to wreck?

you could be my silver spring
blue-green colors flashing
i would be your only dream
your shining autumn ocean crashing


don't say that she's pretty?
and did you say that she loved you?
baby, i don't want to know


so i begin not to love you
turn around, see me running
i say i loved you years ago
but tell myself you never loved me, no


don't say that she's pretty?
and did you say that she loved you?
baby, i don't want to know


oh no, and can you tell me was it worth it?
baby, i don't want to know


time cast a spell on you
but you won't forget me
i know i could have loved you
but you would not let me

time cast a spell on you
but you won't forget me
i know i could have loved you
but you would not let me


i follow you down until the sound
of my voice will haunt you
you'll never get away from the sound
of the woman who loves you

give me just a chance
i follow you down until the sound
of my voice will haunt you
was i just a fool
you'll never get away from the sound
of the woman who loves you

give me just a chance
i follow you down until the sound
of my voice will haunt you
was i just a fool
you'll never get away from the sound
of the woman who loves you

give me just a chance
i follow you down until the sound
of my voice will haunt you
was i just a fool
you'll never get away from the sound
of the woman who loves you

you could be my silver spring
blue-green colors flashing

how deeply are you sleeping or are you still awake?
a good friend told me you've been staying out so late
be careful, oh, my darling, oh, be careful what it takes
from what i've seen so far, the good ones always seem to break
and i was screaming at my father and you were screaming at me
and i can feel your anger from way across the sea
and i was kissing strangers, i was causing such a scene
oh, the heart it hides such unimaginable things


grab me by my ankles, i've been flying for too long
i couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song
and i want you so badly, but you could be anyone
i couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song


hold me down, i'm so tired now
aim your arrow at the sky
take me down, i'm too tired now
leave me where i lie


and i can tell that i'm in trouble when that music starts to play
in a city without seasons, it keeps raining in la
i feel like i'm about to fall, the room begins to sway
and i can hear the sirens but i cannot walk away


grab me by my ankles, i've been flying for too long
i couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song
and i want you so badly, but you could be anyone
i couldn't hide from the thunder in a sky full of song


hold me down, i'm so tired now
aim your arrow at the sky
take me down, i'm too tired now
leave me where i lie


i thought i was flying but maybe i'm dying tonight
i thought i was flying but maybe i'm dying tonight
and i thought i was flying but maybe i'm dying tonight
and i thought i was flying but maybe i'm dying tonight


hold me down, i'm so tired now
aim your arrow at the sky (shoot, shoot, shoot)
take me down, i'm too tired now
leave me where i lie (fire)


hold me down, i'm too tired now
aim your arrow at the sky (shoot, shoot, shoot)
and take me down, i'm too tired now
leave me where i lie (fire)

when i go home alone
i drive past the place where i was born
and the places where i used to drink
young and drunk and stumbling in the street
outside the joiners arms like foals unsteady on their feet
with the art students and the boys in bands
high on e and holding hands with someone that i just met


i thought, "it doesn't get better than this
there can be nothing better than this, better than this."


and we climbed onto the roof of the museum
and someone made love in the grass
and i forgot my name
and the way back to my mother's house
with your blackpool eyes and your bitten lips
the world is at your fingertips


it doesn't get better than this
what else could be better than this?


oh, do you know what i've seen?
i have seen the fields aflame
and everything i ever did
was just another way to scream your name


over and over and over and over again
over and over and over and over again


and we're just children wanting children of our own
i want  a space to watch things grow
but did i dream too big? do i have to let it go?
and what if one day there is no such thing as snow?
oh god, what do i know?


and i don't know anything
except that green is so green
and there's a special kind of sadness that seems to come with spring


oh, do you know what i have seen?
i have seen the fields aflame
but everything i ever did
was just another way to scream your name


over and over and over and over again
over and over and over and over again


oh, do you know what i've seen?
i have seen the fields aflame
but everything i ever did
was just another way to scream your name

another conversation with no destination
another battle never won
and each side is a loser
so who cares who fired the gun?


and i'm learning, so i'm leaving
and even though i'm grieving
i'm trying to find the meaning
letting loss reveal it
letting loss reveal it


st. jude, the patron saint of the lost causes
st. jude, we were lost before she started
st. jude, we lay in bed as she whipped around us
st. jude, maybe i've always been more comfortable in chaos


and i was on the island and you were there too
but somehow through the storm i couldn't get to you
st. jude, somehow she knew
and she came to give her blessing while causing devastation
and i couldn't keep my mouth shut, i just had to mention
grabbing your attention


st. jude, the patron saint of the lost causes
st. jude, we were lost before she started
st. jude, we lay in bed as she whipped around us
st. jude, maybe i've always been more comfortable in chaos


st. jude, st. jude
st. jude, st. jude


and i'm learning, so i'm leaving
and even though i'm grieving
i'm trying to find the meaning
letting loss reveal it
letting loss reveal it
and i'm learning, so i'm leaving
and even though i'm grieving
i'm trying to find the meaning
letting loss reveal it
letting loss reveal it

just as long as you stand, stand by me


so darling, darling stand by me
oh, stand by me

hydrogen in our veins, it cannot hold itself, our blood is burning

your songs remind me of swimming
which i forgot when i started to sink


dragged further away from the shore
and deeper into the drink

sat on the bottom of the ocean
a stern and stubborn rock




i was sinking, but now i'm sunk
i was drinking, and now i'm drunk




i tried to remember the chorus
i can't remember the verse
because that song that sent me swimming
is now the life jacket that burst
rotting like a wreck on the ocean floor
sinking like a siren that can't swim any more

chorus


pull me out the water, cold and blue
i open my eyes and see that it's you
so i'll dive straight back in the ocean
yes i'll dive straight back in the ocean

take a deep breath, suck the water in my chest
take a deep breath, suck the water in my chest
cross my fingers, and hope for the best

then all of a sudden, i heard a note
it started in my chest, and ended in my throat
and then i realised 


i was swimming
yes, i was swimming
and now i'm swimming
yes, i am swimming



know you’ve been hurt by someone else
i can tell by the way you carry yourself
if you let me, here’s what i’ll do
i’ll take care of you
because i’ve loved and i’ve lost


i’ve asked about you and they told me things
but my mind didn’t change and i still feel the same
what's a life with no fun, please don’t be so ashamed
i’ve had mine, you’ve had yours, we both know
we know, they don’t get you like i will
my only wish is i die real
because that truth hurts, and those lies heal
and you can’t sleep thinking that he lies still
so you cry still, tears all in the pillow case
big girls all get a little taste
pushing me away so i give her space
dealing with a heart that i didn’t break
i’ll be there for you, i will care for you
i keep thinking you just don’t know
trying to run from that, say you’re done with that
on your face girl, it just don’t show
when you’re ready, just say you’re ready
when all the baggage just ain’t as heavy
and the parties over, just don’t forget me
we’ll change the pace and we'll just go slow
you won’t ever have to worry
you won’t ever have to hide
you've seen all my mistakes
so look me in my eyes


know you’ve been hurt by someone else
i can tell by the way you carry yourself
if you let me, here’s what i’ll do
i’ll take care of you
because i’ve loved and i’ve lost


it’s my birthday, i'll get high if i want to
can’t deny that i want you, but i'll lie if i have to
because you don’t say you love me
to your friends when they ask you
even though we both know that you do (you do)
one time, been in love one time
you and all your girls in the club one time
all so convinced that you’re following your heart
because your mind don’t control what it does sometimes
we all have our nights though, don’t be so ashamed
i’ve had mine, you’ve had yours, we both know
we know


know you’ve been hurt by someone else
i can tell by the way you carry yourself
if you let me, here’s what i’ll do
i’ll take care of you
because i’ve loved and i’ve lost


i've loved and i've lost
i've loved and i've lost
i've loved and i've lost
old hope
got stuck in your throat
wound its way around your neck
and caused you to choke
old hope
made of rope
that held you tight when the chair legs broke


when they found you hanging in the wood
you said at least now i don't have to be kind or good
i'll be cruel and i'll be obscene
tear out my tongue
cause i've been redeemed
when they found you hanging in the wood
you said at least now i don't have to be kind or good
i'll be cruel and i'll be obscene
tear out my tongue
cause i've been redeemed

save my blushes for the grave
no shy glance, no coy restraint
and i won't hang my head
and i won't repent
won't face the wall and count to ten
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten

well they tore you down
and they tore out your tongue
and they made you kneel
for all the things that you'd done
but you wouldn't cry
and you would't beg
you just grinned
and tore out your teeth instead


when they found you hanging in the wood
you said at least now i don't have to be kind or good
i'll be cruel and i'll be obscene
tear out my tongue
cause i've been redeemed

i don't have to sit down and behave
cause my darling i've been saved

i feel nervous in a way that can't be named
i dreamt last night of a sign that read "the end of love"
and i remember thinking
even in my dreaming
it was a good line for a song


we were a family pulled from the flood
you tore the floorboards up
and let the river rush in
not wash away, wash away


we were reaching in the dark
that summer in new york
and it was so far to fall
but it didn't hurt at all
and let it wash away, wash away


in a moment of joy and fury i threw myself
from the balcony like my grandmother so many years before me
i've always been in love with you
could you tell it from the moment that i met you?


we were a family pulled from the flood
you tore the floorboards up
and let the river rush in
not wash away, wash away


we were reaching in the dark (wash away)
that summer in new york (wash away)
and was it so far to fall? (wash away)
you said it didn't hurt at all
and let it wash away, wash away


and joshua came down from the mountain
with a tablet in his hands
told me that he loved me, yeah
and then ghosted me again


we were reaching in the dark
that summer in new york
and it was so far to fall
but it didn't hurt at all
i let it wash away, wash away


reaching in the dark (wash away)
that summer in new york (wash away)
and was it so far to fall? (wash away)
you said it didn't hurt at all
and let it wash away, wash away

i built a man made out of bricks, and lived inside his chest
i beat my head against the wall to make a heart beat in his breast
i smashed my fist against his ribs to suck the air inside
and swing by swing, and blow by blow, i brought that man to life

i built a man and cut his skin, and lived inside his heart
i pumped it with my fingertips, and loved it from the start
and with every beat i gave him a heartbeat of my own
and i filled his veins with the blood i had

till his blood
till his blood
till his blood
was my own

oh, i'd build you up, but we're not made of the same stuff
and even though i knocked you down, you're so much stronger than me
well, i would build you up, but we're not made of the same stuff

it's times like these you learn to live again
it's times like these you give and give again

i'm a brand new sky to hang the stars upon tonight
i, i'm a little divided
do i stay or run away and leave it all behind?

jesus freaks out in the street
handing tickets out for god
turning back she just laughs

piano man he makes his stand
in the auditorium
looking on she sings the songs
the words she knows the tune she hums


but oh how it feels so real
lying here with no one near
only you and you can hear me
when i say softly, slowly


hold me closer tiny dancer
count the headlights on the highway
lay me down in sheets of linen
you had a busy day today

and the crown, it weighs heavy
'til it's banging on my eyelids
retreating in covers and closing the curtains
one thing's for certain, oh
a year like this passes so strangely
somewhere between sorrow and bliss


oh, who decides from where up high?
i couldn't say "i need more time"
oh, grant that i can stay the night
or one more day inside this life

ooh she may be weary
young girls they do get weary
wearing that same old shaggy dress
but when she get weary
try a little tenderness

you know she's waiting
just anticipating
the thing that she'll never, never, never possess
but while she's waiting
try a little tenderness

it's not sentimental, no, no, no
she has - her greaves and care
but the soft words they are spoken so gentle
makes it easier to bear

you won't regret it, no
young girls they don't forget it
love is their whole happiness

but it's all so easy
all you gotta do is try
all you gotta do is
squeeze her
don't tease her
never leave her

try a little tenderness
don't leave her, no, no
try a little tenderness

and the air was full
of various storms and saints
parading in the streets
as the banks began to break
and i'm in the throes of it
somewhere in the belly of the beast
but you took your toll on me
so i gave myself over willingly
you got a hold on me
and i don't know how i don't just stand outside and scream
i am teaching myself how to be free


the monument of a memory
you tear it down in your head
don't make the mountain your enemy
get out, get up there instead
you saw the stars out in front of you
too tempting not to touch
but even though it shocked you
something's electric in your blood


can people just untie themselves
uncurling like flowers
if you could just forgive yourself


but still you stumble, your feet give way
outside the world seems a violent place
but you had to have him, and so you did
some things you let go in order to live
while all around you, the buildings sway
you sing it out loud, "who made us this way?"
i know you're bleeding, but you'll be okay
hold on to your heart, you'll keep it safe
hold on to your heart, don't give it away


now find a rooftop to sing from
now find a hallway to dance
you don't need no edge to cling from
your heart is there, it's in your hands
i know it seems like forever
i know it seems like an age
but one day this will be over
i swear it's not so far away


can people just untie themselves
uncurling like flowers
if you could just forgive yourself


but still you stumble, your feet give way
outside the world seems a violent place
but you had to have him, and so you did
some things you let go in order to live
while all around you, the buildings sway
you sing it out loud, "who made us this way?"
i know you're bleeding, but you'll be okay
hold on to your heart, you'll keep it safe
hold on to your heart

i was on a heavy tip
trying to cross a canyon with a broken limb
you were on the other side, like always
wondering what to do with life


i'd already had a sip
so i'd reasoned i was drunk enough to deal with it
you were on the other side, like always
you could never make your mind


and with one kiss
you inspired a fire of devotion that lasts for twenty years
what kind of man loves like this?


to let me dangle at a cruel angle
oh, my feet don't touch the floor
sometimes you're half in and then you're half out
but you never close the door


what kind of man loves like this?
what kind of man?
what kind of man loves like this?
what kind of man?


you're a holy fool, all coloured blue
red feet upon the floor
you do such damage, how do you manage?
to have me crawling back for more


and with one kiss
and with one kiss
you inspired a fire of devotion that lasts for twenty years
for twenty years
what kind of man loves like this?


what kind of man loves like this?
what kind of man?
what kind of man loves like this?
what kind of man?


but i can't beat ya, 'cause i'm still with ya
"oh mercy", i implore
"oh mercy", i implore
how do you do it? i think i'm through it
then i'm back against the wall
back, back, back against the wall


what kind of man loves like this?
what kind of man?
what kind of man loves like this?
what kind of man?


what kind of man loves like this?
what kind of man?
what kind of man loves like this?
what kind of man?

time it took us
to where the water was
that’s what the water gave me
and time goes quicker
between the two of us
but oh, my love, don’t forsake me
take what the water gave me


lay me down
let the only sound
be the overflow
pockets full of stones
lay me down
let the only sound
be the overflow


and oh, poor atlas
the world’s a beast of a burden
you’ve been holding on a long time
and all this longing
and the ships are left to rust
that’s what the water gave us


so lay me down
let the only sound
be the overflow
pockets full of stones
lay me down
let the only sound
be the overflow


because they took your loved ones
but returned them in exchange for you
but would you have it any other way?
would you have it any other way?
you couldn't have it any other way


because she’s a cruel mistress
and a bargain must be made
but oh, my love, don’t forget me
while i let the water take me


lay me down
let the only sound
be the overflow
pockets full of stones
lay me down
let the only sound
be the overflow

so lay me down
let the only sound
be the overflow
pockets full of stones
lay me down
let the only sound
be the overflow

and it's my whole heart
weighed and measured inside
and it's an old scar
trying to bleach it out
and it's my whole heart
deemed and delivered a crime
i'm on trial, waiting 'til the beat comes out
i'm on trial, waiting 'til the beat comes out


who's a heretic now?
am i making sense?
how can you make it stick?
waiting 'til the beat comes out
who's a heretic, child?
can you make it stick, now?
and i'm on trial
waiting 'til the beat comes out


i'm miles away, he's on my mind
i'm getting tired of crawling all the way
i've had enough, it's obvious
and i'm getting tired of crawling all the way
crawling all the way
crawling all the way


i'm not beaten by this yet
you can't tell me to regret
been in the dark since the day we met
fire, help me to forget
i'm not beaten by this yet
you can't tell me to regret
been in the dark since the day we met
fire, help me to forget


and it's my whole heart
while tried and tested, it's mine
and it's my whole heart
trying to reach it out
and it's my whole heart
burned but not buried this time
i'm on trial, waiting 'til the beat comes out
i'm on trial, waiting 'til the beat comes out


i'm miles away, he's on my mind
i'm getting tired of crawling all the way
i've had enough, it's obvious
and i'm getting tired of crawling all the way


i'm not beaten by this yet
you can't tell me to regret
been in the dark since the day we met
fire, help me to forget
i'm not beaten by this yet
you can't tell me to regret
been in the dark since the day we met
fire, help me to forget


chained and shackled, oh
i'll unravel, oh
it's a pity, oh
never to return
but i never learn
it's a pity, oh
chained and shackled, oh
i'll unravel, oh
it's a pity, oh
say i won't return
but i never learn
it's a pity, oh
ooh...

i tried to leave it all behind me
but i woke up and there they were beside me
and i don't believe it but i guess it's true
some feelings, they can travel too
oh there it is again, sitting on my chest
makes it hard to catch my breath
i scramble for the light of change


you're always on my mind
you're always on my mind


and i never minded being on my own
then something broke in me and i wanted to go home
to be where you are
but even closer to you, you seem so very far
and now i'm reaching out with every note i sing
and i hope it gets to you on some pacific wind
wraps itself around you and whispers in your ear
tells you that i miss you and i wish that you were here


and if i stay, oh, i don't know
there'll be so much that i'll have to let go
you're disappearing all the time
but i still see you in the light
for you, the shadows fight
and it's beautiful but there's that tug inside
i must stop time traveling, you're always on my mind


you're always on my mind
you're always on my mind


and i never minded being on my own
then something broke in me and i wanted to go home
to be where you are
but even closer to you, you seem so very far
and now i'm reaching out with every note i sing
and i hope it gets to you on some pacific wind
wraps itself around you and whispers in your ear
tells you that i miss you and i wish that you were here


we all need something watching over us
be it the falcons, the clouds or the cross
and then the sea swept in and left us all speechless
speechless


and i never minded being on my own
then something broke in me and i wanted to go home
to be where you are
but even closer to you, you seem so very far
and now i'm reaching out with every note i sing
and i hope it gets to you on some pacific wind
wraps itself around you and whispers in your ear
tells you that i miss you and i wish that you were here


wish that you were here
wish that you were here
wish that you were here
i wish that you...

sometimes, i feel like throwing my hands up in the air
i know i can count on you
sometimes, i feel like saying, "lord, i just don't care"
but you've got the love i need to see me through


sometimes, it seems the going is just too rough
and things go wrong no matter what i do
now and then, it seems that life is just too much
but you've got the love i need to see me through
