I think I'm through it\nThen I'm back against the wall\nBack, back, back against the wall\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat kind of man loves like this?\nWhat kind of man?\nWhat kind of man loves like this?\nWhat kind of man?\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat kind of man loves like this?\nWhat kind of man?\nWhat kind of man loves like this?\nWhat kind of man?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/acaa446d6bade69f684de5379ecd3ff8.1000x997x1.png"}], "artist": "Florence + The Machine"}
