Do you feel loved?\nShe told me all doors are open to the believer\nI believe her, I believe her, I believe her\nDo you feel loved?\n\n[Chorus]\nOh Patricia, you've always been my North Star, oh\nOh Patricia, you've always been my North Star, oh\n\n[Outro]\nI drink too much coffee and think of you often\nIn a city where reality has long been forgotten\nAnd are you afraid? 'Cause I'm terrified\nBut you remind me that it's such a wonderful thing to love\nIt's such a wonderful thing to love\nIt's such a wonderful thing to love\nIt's such a wonderful thing to love\nIt's such a wonderful thing\nIt's such a wonderful thing to love\nIt's such a wonderful thing to love\nIt's such a wonderful thing to love\nIt's such a wonderful thing to love\nIt's such a wonderful thing", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2d92b5782c23d003af4ee7d2a2d81809.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Florence + The Machine"}
