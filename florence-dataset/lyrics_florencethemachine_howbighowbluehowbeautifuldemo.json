(beautiful)\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd every city was a gift\nEvery skyline like a kiss upon the lips\nAnd every city was a gift\nEvery skyline like a kiss upon the lips\nAnd meanwhile a man was falling from space\nAnd every day I wore your face\nEvery skyline like a kiss upon the lips\nLike an atmosphere around me\nAnd every city was a gift\nThe satellite beside me\n\n[Bridge]\nSo much time on the other side\nWaiting for you to wake up\nSo much time on the other side\nWaiting for you to wake up\n\n[Chorus]\nHow big, how blue, how beautiful\nHow big, how blue, how...\n\n[Verse 4]\nAnd every city was a gift\nAnd every skyline was like a kiss upon the lips\nAnd every city was a gift\nAnd every skyline\nAnd meanwhile a man was falling from space\nBig! Big! Blue! Blue!\nAnd every day I wore your face\nBeautiful! Beautiful!\nLike an atmosphere around me\nBig! Big! Blue! Blue!\nI'm happy you're beside me\nBeautiful! Beautiful!\n\n[Outro]\nAnd every city was a gift\nEvery skyline like a kiss upon the lips\nAnd every city was a gift\nAnd every skyline like a kiss upon the lips\nBig! Blue! Beautiful!\nBig! Blue!
