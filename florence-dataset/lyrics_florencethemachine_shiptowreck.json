Am I losing touch?\nDid I build a ship to wreck?\n\n[Chorus]\nTo wreck, to wreck, to wreck\nDid I build this ship to wreck?\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhat's with the long face? Do you want more?\nThousands of red-eyed mice, scratching at the door\nAnd don't let the curtain catch you, cause you've been here before\nThe chair is an island, darling, you can't touch the floor\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd, ah, my love remind me, what was it that I said?\nI can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed\nAnd, ah, my love remind me, what was it that I did?\nDid I drink too much? Am I losing touch?\nDid I build a ship to wreck?\n\n[Chorus]\nTo wreck, to wreck, to wreck\nDid I build this ship to wreck?\n\n[Bridge]\nGood God, under starless skies\nWe are lost, and into the breach, we got tossed\nAnd the water's coming in fast\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd, ah, my love remind me, what was it that I said?\nI can't help but pull the earth around me to make my bed\nAnd, ah, my love remind me, what was it that I did?\nDid I drink too much? Am I losing touch?\nDid I build a ship to wreck?\n\n[Chorus]\nTo wreck, to wreck, to wreck\nDid I build this ship to wreck?\nTo wreck, to wreck, to wreck\nDid I build this ship to wreck?", "image": "https://images.genius.com/d7ff2f58835832138476d505a068ee76.1000x1000x1.png"}], "artist": "Florence + The Machine"}
