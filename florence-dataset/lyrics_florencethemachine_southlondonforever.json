Do I have to let it go?\nAnd what if one day there is no such thing as snow?\nOh God, what do I know?\n\n[Interlude]\nAnd I don't know anything\nExcept that green is so green\nAnd there's a special kind of sadness that seems to come with spring\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, do you know what I have seen?\nI have seen the fields aflame\nBut everything I ever did\nWas just another way to scream your name\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nOver and over and over and over again\nOver and over and over and over again\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, do you know what I've seen?\nI have seen the fields aflame\nBut everything I ever did\nWas just another way to scream your name", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2d92b5782c23d003af4ee7d2a2d81809.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Florence + The Machine"}
