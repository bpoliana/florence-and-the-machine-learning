(Raise it up)\n\nYou made a deal, and now it seems you have to offer up\nBut will it ever be enough? (Raise it up, raise it up)\nIt's not enough (Raise it up, raise it up)\n\nHere I am, a rabbit-hearted girl\nFrozen in the headlights\nIt seems I've made the final sacrifice\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWe raise it up, this offering\nWe raise it up\n\n[Chorus]\nThis is a gift, it comes with a price\nWho is the lamb and who is the knife?\nMidas is king and he holds me so tight\nAnd turns me to gold in the sunlight\n\n[Verse 2]\nI look around, but I can't find you (raise it up)\nIf only I could see your face (raise it up)\nInstead of rushing towards the skyline (raise it up)\nI wish that I could just be brave\n\nI must become a lion-hearted girl\nReady for a fight\nBefore I make the final sacrifice\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWe raise it up, this offering\nWe raise it up\n\n[Chorus]\nThis is a gift, it comes with a price\nWho is the lamb and who is the knife?\nMidas is king and he holds me so tight\nAnd turns me to gold in the sunlight\n\n[Bridge]\nRaise it up, raise it up\nRaise it up, raise it up\nAnd in the spring I shed my skin\nAnd it blows away with the changing wind\nThe waters turn from blue to red\nAs towards the sky I offer it\n\n[Chorus]\nThis is a gift, it comes with a price\nWho is the lamb and who is the knife?\nMidas is king and he holds me so tight\nAnd turns me to gold in the sunlight\n\n[Chorus]\nThis is a gift, it comes with a price\nWho is the lamb and who is the knife?\nMidas is king and he holds me so tight\nAnd turns me to gold in the sunlight\n\n[Chorus]\nThis is a gift, it comes with a price\nWho is the lamb and who is the knife?\nMidas is king and he holds me so tight\nAnd turns me to gold in the sunlight\n\n[Outro]\nThis is a gift", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8c25f2fbd6eb11387dbe10a1c6291cbb.500x500x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Florence + The Machine"}
