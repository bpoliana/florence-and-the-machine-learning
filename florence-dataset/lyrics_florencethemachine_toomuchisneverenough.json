A hundred flags flying in a field)\nI couldn't say \"I need more time\"\n([?]They all called my name, felt it let go of me)\nOh, grant that I can stay the night\n(What happened here? A hundred flags flying in a field)\nOr one more day inside this life\n([?]They all called my name, felt it let go of me)\n\n[Chorus]\nToo much, too much, too much, too much, too much\nNever enough\nToo much, too much, too much, too much, too much\nNever enough\nToo much, too much, too much, too much, too much\nNever enough\nToo much, too much, too much, too much, too much\nNever, never, ever enough\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd who cares about the thing I did that night?\nSo what? Maybe Luna had it right\nAnd who cares if I'm coming back alive?\nSo what? 'Least I have the strength to fight\n\n[Chorus]\nToo much, too much, too much, too much, too much\nNever enough\nToo much, too much, too much, too much, too much\nNever enough\nToo much, too much, too much, too much, too much\nNever enough\nToo much, too much, too much, too much, too much\nNever, never, ever enough\n\n[Outro]\nWhat happened here? A hundred flags flying in a field\n[?][?]They all called my name, felt it let go of me\nWhat happened here? A hundred flags flying in a field\n[?]They all called my name, felt it let go of me\nA hundred flags flying in a field\n[?]They all called my name felt it let go of me\nWhat happened here? A hundred flags flying in a field\n[?]They all called my name, felt it let go of me", "image": "https://images.genius.com/997a9ec62676efb4f5dad1b5a1068f72.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Florence + The Machine"}
