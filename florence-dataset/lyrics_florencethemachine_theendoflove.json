(Wash away)\nYou said it didn't hurt at all\nAnd let it wash away, wash away\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd Joshua came down from the mountain\nWith a tablet in his hands\nTold me that he loved me, yeah\nAnd then ghosted me again\n\n[Chorus]\nWe were reaching in the dark\nThat summer in New York\nAnd it was so far to fall\nBut it didn't hurt at all\nI let it wash away, wash away\n\n[Chorus]\nReaching in the dark (Wash away)\nThat summer in New York (Wash away)\nAnd was it so far to fall? (Wash away)\nYou said it didn't hurt at all\nAnd let it wash away, wash away", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2d92b5782c23d003af4ee7d2a2d81809.800x800x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Florence + The Machine"}
