Whose side am I?\nWhose side am I on? Whose side am I?\n\nAnd the fever began to spread\nFrom my heart down to my legs\nBut the room is so quiet, oh oh oh oh\n\nAnd although I wasn't losing my mind\nIt was a chorus so sublime\nBut the room is so quiet, oh oh oh\n\n[Chorus]\nI was looking for a breath of a life\nFor a little touch of heavenly light\nBut all the choirs in my head sang, no, oh oh oh\n\nTo get a dream of life again\nA little vision of the start and the end\nBut all the choirs in my head sang, no, oh oh oh\n\n[Bridge]\nIt's a harder way and it's come to claim her\nAnd I always say, we should be together\nAnd I can't sleep alone, because there's something in here\nAnd if you are gone, I will not belong here (belong, belong, belong)\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd I started to hear it again\nBut this time it wasn't the end\nAnd the room is so quiet, oh oh oh oh\n\nAnd my heart is a hollow plain\nFor the devil to dance again\nAnd the room is too quiet, oh oh oh oh\n\n[Chorus]\nI was looking for a breath of a life\nFor a little touch of heavenly light\nBut all the choirs in my head sang, no, oh oh oh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/bb45684878c4f156e5db865d892e0863.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Florence + The Machine"}
