I hear its sad song\n\n[Verse 2]\nI need the clouds to cover me\nPulling them down, surround me\nWithout your love I'll be\nSo long and lost, are you missing me?\n\n[Chorus]\nIs it too late to come on home?\nAre all those bridges now old stone?\nIs it too late to come on home?\nCan the city forgive? I hear its sad song\n\n[Bridge]\nIt's been so long between the words we spoke\nWill you be there up on the shore, I hope\nYou wonder why it is that I came home\nI figured out where I belong\n\n[Chorus]\nBut it's too late to come on home\nAre all those bridges now old stone?\nBut it's too late to come on home\nCan the city forgive? I hear its sad song", "image": "https://images.genius.com/93dc60e6bd7566830fa736618cb4f114.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Florence + The Machine"}
